# Autocomplete-Search for GitHub

My solution to coding problem

## Installation

Autocomplete-Search for GitHub requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the app.

```sh
cd nomade
yarn
yarn start
```

## What do you like about your solution?

I tried to create a clean, presentable solution.

## What do you dislike about your solution?

- I got stucked with a few problems and only tried to hack it rather than redo the hole part. (I could not get rid of borders in resultList)
- I was afraid of the time slot, so I decided to clean up as much as possible rather than start from blank project again.

## If you had more time, what would you have been improving?

- I am not very much satisfied with the tests,
- the clean-up of the application
- change the Autocomplete package
- create a env file to store the token
- I did not move all the styles into styles variable
- I did not used separate handler/function inside of onPress attribute

## If you could start again from scratch, what would you do differently?

- I would not use the predefined expo project, but start with blank one.
- I would not use the react-native-autocomplete-input package

## What were the most significant challenges solving the assignment?

- I would say that the challenge was quiet straightforward and easy. I have developed main parts of the solution in an 1:45. The rest of the time I have spend with the ugly borders, tests, cleanUp of unnecessary code.
